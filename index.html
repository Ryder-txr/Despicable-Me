          Lyrics: 
          <br>
            I'm having a bad bad day
            <br>
          It's about time that I get my way
          <br>                                        
          Steam rolling whatever I see, huh
          <br>
          Despicable me
          <br>
          I'm having a bad bad day
          <br>
          If you take it personal that's okay
          <br>
          Watch this is so fun to see, huh
          <br>
          Despicable me
          <br>
          Why ask why better yet why not
          <br>
          Why are you marking x on that spot
          <br>
          Why use a blow torch isn't that hot?
          <br>
          Why use a chainsaw is that all you got
          <br>
          Why do you like seeing people in shock
          <br>
          But my question to you is why not
          <br>
          Why go to the bank and stand in line
          <br>

                <h6>Longtime supervillain Felonious Gru has his pride hurt when an unknown rival steals the Great Pyramid of Giza. Gru, his elderly assistant Dr. Nefario, and his army of Minions devise a plan to steal the Moon. Seeking financial assistance, Gru approaches Mr. Perkins, the director of the Bank of Evil, who orders Gru to procure a shrink ray. While at the bank, Gru meets budding supervillain Vector, who was responsible for the Pyramid heist. Gru and two of his Minions obtain the shrink ray from a research base in Southeast Asia, only for Vector to ambush them and steal it for himself.

                  After many failed attempts to infiltrate Vector's fortress, Gru notices three orphaned girls, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, being allowed in to sell cookies to Vector. Gru adopts the girls under the guise of a dentist, using them to distract Vector while he reclaims the shrink ray. He tries to abandon the girls at an amusement park, but starts to bond with them.
                  
                  Gru later shows Perkins the shrink ray through a video call, only to be met with rejection. Observing Gru's despair, the girls offer him their piggy bank, and the Minions pool their resources to fund the moon heist. Meanwhile, Perkins informs Vector, who is revealed to be his son, of Gru's current possession of the shrink ray, prompting Vector to take action on thwarting Gru's plan. Nefario calculates the day when the Moon is closest to Earth, which unfortunately coincides with the girls' ballet recital.
                  
                  Believing the girls are too much of a distraction to Gru, Nefario calls the orphanage's owner, Miss Hattie, to take the girls back. Gru decides to steal the moon by himself, leaving Nefario in his lab. The next day, Gru successfully shrinks and steals the Moon. Hoping to make it to the recital on time, he rushes back to Earth, but finds that the recital has ended and that Vector has kidnapped the girls.
                  
                  Arriving at Vector's fortress, Gru surrenders the Moon to Vector, but Vector refuses to give back the girls. Enraged, Gru storms Vector's fortress, intent on revenge. After Gru sidesteps all of the fortress's defenses, Vector panics and activates his escape aircraft. Meanwhile, Nefario and the Minions discover that the shrink ray's effects are temporary; the bigger an object, the faster it reverts to its normal size. Gru, Nefario, and the Minions rescue the girls before the Moon returns to its normal size and launches itself into orbit, destroying Vector's aircraft and leaving him stranded. Gru reclaims custody of the girls, and they celebrate with a special ballet recital that becomes a dance party.

                <h6>A mysterious aircraft steals a highly potent mutagen known as PX-41 from a laboratory in the Arctic Circle. Silas Ramsbottom, director of the Anti-Villain League (AVL), sends agent Lucy Wilde to recruit former supervillain Gru, who is forcibly brought to their headquarters and asked to help them track down the culprit and recover the mutagen. However, Gru refuses and informs Silas and Lucy that he has enough responsibilities as a father and as the owner of a jelly-producing business. Later, Dr. Nefario quits to accept a job offer to assist another villain; this causes a reluctant Gru to decide to work with the AVL after all. He and Lucy are partnered and stationed at a shopping mall, with a cupcake store as their front.

                  Gru immediately suspects that Mexican restaurant owner Eduardo Pérez might be "El Macho", a supervillain who was presumed dead after riding a shark into an active volcano with two hundred fifty pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest. That night, Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo's restaurant, but find no evidence that Eduardo has done anything villainous. Meanwhile, Gru's three adopted daughters, Margo, Edith and Agnes, who dream of having a mother one day, believe that Gru will eventually fall in love with Lucy. Gru denies it, saying his relationship with Lucy is only professional.
                  
                  Despite holding Eduardo as his prime suspect, Gru agrees to pursue other leads, including the shop of wig merchant Floyd Eaglesan, where Lucy discovers traces of the mutagen. After witnessing Eduardo's son, Antonio, woo Margo, Gru renews his focus on Eduardo, who in turn invites the family to his Cinco de Mayo party. Gru's neighbor, Jillian, sets him up on a blind date that goes wrong with Shannon, who tries to take Gru's wig, but Lucy saves Gru from embarrassment by shooting Shannon in the behind with a tranquilizer dart; Lucy helps Gru escape and the two form a friendship. The AVL arrests Floyd after finding an nearly-empty jar of the mutagen in his shop. Ramsbottom then closes the investigation and reassigns Lucy to Australia, leaving Gru heartbroken.
                  
                  At the party, Gru follows him and discovers that Eduardo is indeed El Macho. Having faked his death and with Nefario as his assistant, El Macho has kidnapped most of Gru's Minions and used the mutagen to mutate them into purple mindless and indestructible monsters, intent on using them to conquer the world. El Macho offers Gru the chance to team up with him, but Gru becomes terrified and leaves with his daughters. Suspicious, El Macho sends one of the mutated Minions, Kevin, after them.
                  
                  Lucy, having decided to disobey orders and return home, arrives at the party right after Gru leaves. Realizing that Gru and Lucy are working for the AVL, El Macho kidnaps Lucy; this is witnessed by Nefario, who subsequently informs Gru of the situation. Gru infiltrates El Macho's fortress by pretending to have been kidnapped by two mutated Minions (who are normal Minions in disguise), but the real mutated Minions see through the ruse and attack them. Meanwhile, Kevin breaks into Gru's house and attacks Margo and Agnes. They lure him to Gru's lab, where Nefario arrives with an antidote to reverse Kevin's mutation. Nefario laces Gru's jelly with the antidote. He, the girls, and the surviving Minions hurry to Gru's aid and cure the mutated Minions. El Macho, distraught, threatens to murder Lucy by sending her into the volcano where he previously faked his death and uses the mutagen himself to battle Gru, but Gru and Nefario manage to defeat him.
                  
                  Gru attempts to free Lucy from the rocket she is tied to, but El Macho's pet chicken, Pollito, activates it. Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date and they jump into the ocean before the rocket enters the volcano. Months later, after going on one hundred forty-seven dates, Gru and Lucy get married, and Lucy becomes the girls' adoptive mother.

                <h6>Married Anti-Villain League (AVL) agents Felonious Gru and Lucy Wilde are sent to recover the stolen Dumont Diamond from Balthazar Bratt, a former child star who became a supervillain after his show, Evil Bratt, was canceled. Gru recovers the diamond, while Bratt escapes. At the AVL headquarters, director Silas Ramsbottom announces his retirement, and appoints board member Valerie Da Vinci as the new director. Da Vinci dismisses Gru and Lucy from the AVL, believing they should have captured Bratt during the mission.

                  When Gru and Lucy return home, they tell their adopted daughters Margo, Edith, and Agnes of their dismissal, but assure them they will soon have new jobs. When Gru refuses to return to being a supervillain, and with his assistant Dr. Nefario accidentally frozen in carbonite,[a] most of his Minions, led by Mel, abandon him to find new jobs. They eventually land in jail after accidentally crashing into a television studio.
                  
                  A butler named Fritz arrives at Gru's home with an invitation from his long-lost twin brother Dru, who lives in a distant country named Freedonia. The family travels to meet Dru, and are surprised by his immense wealth and mansion. Meanwhile, Bratt steals the diamond again, intending to use it to power a giant robot that will destroy Hollywood, as revenge for his show's cancelation. Dru reveals to Gru that their dead father was a supervillain known as "the Bald Terror", whose villainous activities and technological advances are the real source of the family's wealth. Dru wants Gru to teach him how to become a villain, but Gru refuses to revert to his old ways. While Lucy struggles with her new tasks as a mother, Dru and Gru become closer after joyriding in their father's high-tech vehicle.
                  
                  Gru and Dru decide to steal the diamond; however, Gru secretly intends to bring it to the AVL to convince Da Vinci to rehire him and Lucy. They narrowly escape with the diamond and are rescued by Lucy. Dru, finding out Gru's true motives, is upset that Gru lied about teaching him how to be a villain. In return, Gru berates Dru for his incompetence, disowns him, and decides to leave Freedonia.
                  
                  Bratt, disguised as Lucy, kidnaps the girls, and once again acquires the diamond. Discovering this, Gru and Dru put aside their differences; the brothers and Lucy set off after Bratt in the Bald Terror's vehicle. The Minions, having escaped jail, manage to follow them. With his robot's laser powered by the diamond, Bratt terrorizes Hollywood, covering it in superpowered bubble gum in hopes of lifting the city into outer space. Lucy rescues the girls from a falling skyscraper as Bratt sends Gru and Dru crash-landing into the streets of Hollywood. Bratt tries to kill Gru with the robot's laser, but Dru risks his life to break into the robot and power it down from the inside. Gru engages Bratt in a dance fight before stealing his weaponized keytar to defeat him, and send him float away in bubble gum just as AVL helicopters arrive in time. As the Minions pop the bubble gum bubbles covering the city, Dru and Gru reconcile, and share an embrace with Lucy, Margo, Edith and Agnes.
                  
                  Gru and Lucy are reinstated into the AVL. The newly united family celebrates in Gru's home, and the girls acknowledge Lucy as their mother. Still wishing to be a supervillain, Dru, along with most of the Minions, steals Gru's rocket-powered aircraft and flies away. Gru and Lucy decide to give them a five-minute head-start before engaging in pursuit.

                <h6>Anti-Villain League (AVL) agent Gru attends a reunion at his alma mater, Lycée Pas Bon. There, he reunites with his school rival Maxime Le Mal, who harbors a grudge towards Gru for stealing his talent show act, singing "Karma Chameleon", when they were in school. Maxime reveals he has enhanced himself with cockroach parts to make himself over-powered and able to conquer the world, but Gru arrests him with the help of the AVL. Maxime escapes from the AVL prison the next day with the help of his girlfriend Valentina. He reveals an invention that turns people into human-roach hybrids, which he plans to specifically use on Gru's infant son Gru Jr.

                  Silas Ramsbottom comes out of retirement and visits the Gru household to inform them of Maxime's escape; and that the AVL will have to relocate them to a house in another town named Mayflower until Maxime is recaptured. Assuming new names and identities as part of a witness protection program, Gru becomes Chet, a solar panel salesman, and Lucy becomes Blanche and is given a hairdressing career.[6] Most of the Minions are taken in by the AVL, five of whom are augmented with superpowers, under an initiative called the Mega Minions, which is canceled after the group causes collateral damage in a city.
                  
                  In their new well-off residential town, Gru and his family meet their neighbors, the Prescotts. Their teenage daughter, Poppy, an aspiring villainess, recognizes Gru from his former career as a villain. She threatens to blow Gru's cover unless he helps her pull off a heist to steal Lycée Pas Bon's mascot, a honey badger named Lenny, so she can enroll there. As Lucy stays home with the girls, the pair, with the help of two Minions and Gru Jr., successfully steal Lenny and escape in a flying car. But the school's elderly principal, Frau Übelschlecht, identifies Gru from security camera footage and contacts Maxime to inform him of Gru's whereabouts, using a tracker in Lenny's collar.
                  
                  The next day, Gru and Lucy are away at the local country club with Poppy's parents Perry and Patsy, while Poppy and Lenny are at the safe house with Margo, Edith, Agnes and Gru Jr. Poppy notices Übelschlecht visiting, and quickly leaves with Lenny, leaving Übelschlecht to interrogate the girls about Gru's whereabouts. Gru and Lucy rush home after being called by Margo and fight Übelschlecht. Lucy also contacts the AVL, who in turn summon the Mega Minions to stop Maxime. In the chaos, however, Gru Jr. leaves the house and is spotted by Maxime and Valentina, who kidnap him and take him into their ship. Gru decides to save his son along with Poppy while Lucy and the girls stay behind to handle Übelschlecht.
                  
                  With the help of her cat, Poppy uses the flying car to help Gru get onto the ship. Valentina tries to stop Gru from getting inside, but she is knocked off the roof. The ship crashes into a building under construction, where Maxime reveals he has transformed and brainwashed Gru Jr. into a roach hybrid, and uses him to fight Gru off. Gru is knocked out, but his encouraging words to his son break Gru Jr. from his brainwashed state, and Gru Jr. attacks Maxime instead. Maxime falls off the building and is squashed by the Mega Minions with the aid of animals and insects who have followed them. The AVL and Silas arrive in turn to arrest Maxime and Valentina once again.
                  
                  Returning to the safe house and reunited with Lucy and the girls, Gru thanks Poppy for her help. Gru and his family return home, where Dr. Nefario reverses Gru Jr.'s transformation. Gru visits Maxime, who has also been returned to normal, in the AVL prison to settle their differences. To show their reconciliation, the pair performs "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" for the prisoners, which include several of Gru's past adversaries, while Poppy enrolls at Lycée Pas Bon.</h6>
